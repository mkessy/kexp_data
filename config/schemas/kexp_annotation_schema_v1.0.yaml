description: "Consolidated annotation schema for KEXP DJ comments. Contains all label definitions, detailed guidelines, and illustrative examples. Derived from label_definitions_v1.0.yaml, annotation_guidelines_v1.0.yaml, and docs/annotation_schema.md v4.0."

general_annotation_rules:
  - rule: "Annotate based on explicit information in the text."
  - rule: "If unsure, do not annotate and flag the example if possible."
  - rule: "Span boundaries should be minimal but complete, capturing the entire relevant phrase or thought."
  - rule: "Labels ending in _SPAN typically cover sentences or multi-sentence passages. Labels ending in _TAG are for shorter, specific entity phrases."
  - rule: "When annotating _TAG entities within a _SPAN, ensure the _TAG is also independently valid according to its own definition."
  - rule: "Avoid annotating possessive forms for tags (e.g., for ARTIST_TAG, annotate 'Nirvana' in 'Nirvana's song', not 'Nirvana's')."
