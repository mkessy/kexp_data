## SpanCat Labels (Span Categorization)

### `_SPAN` Suffix Labels (Sentence or Multi-Sentence Level):

1.  **`ARTIST_BIO_LINE_SPAN`**: A declarative sentence or multi-sentence passage providing biographical information about an artist or group. This includes their origin, history, key characteristics, significant achievements, or formation details.

    - _Example_: "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960, comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr."
    - _Typically contains_: SpanCat Tags (`ARTIST_NAME_TAG`, `GENRE_TAG`, `ROLE_TAG`).

2.  **`RELEASE_ANNOUNCEMENT_SPAN`**: A sentence or sentences specifically announcing an upcoming or new release (album, EP, single, etc.), often including its title, the artist's release count (e.g., "4th studio record"), and an explicit release date or timeframe.

    - _Example_: "Their new album, 'Cosmic Echoes', is their third studio effort and is slated for release on October 26th."
    - _Typically contains_: SpanCat Tags (`ALBUM_TITLE_TAG`, `ARTIST_NAME_TAG`, `GENRE_TAG`).

3.  **`SONG_ATTRIBUTION_SPAN`**: A sentence or sentences stating the origin or source of the _currently playing song_ or a song that is the immediate subject of discussion (e.g., pointing to an album, release year, or its status).
