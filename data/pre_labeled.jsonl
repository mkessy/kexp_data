And they either are the kind that think they know, but then as soon as you push them a little bit they’re like 'I don’t know.' Like 'Oh! French people!' Well, do you know the who the president of France is? Then shut up. It’s easy to pick through. But because the rest of the world knows a lot of facts about America I think they know what America’s like from television. Well, that’s not America, that’s American television. \"That’s why people didn’t understand that 'North American Scum' had an element, that I take for granted that Americans are insecure and embarrassed.

Another example of a Radiohead song written in an unusual time signature is \"Morning Bell\" from Amnesiac, which was written in 7/8. When performing, the band sometimes puts these songs together. In an interview with New York magazine, Ed O'Brien explained why they did so at a June 2006 concert at Madison Square Garden: \"Putting '15 Step' and 'Morning Bell' together was deliberate. '15 Step' is in 5/4 and 'Morning Bell' is in 7/8. It's nice to have a bit of clapping, a bit of audience participation, if they can get the beat.

The most well-known example of a song written in a 5/4 meter is \"Take Five\" by The Dave Brubeck Quartet. Another example of a Radiohead song written in an unusual time signature is \"Morning Bell\" from Amnesiac, which was written in 7/8. When performing, the band sometimes puts these songs together. \n\nIn an interview with New York magazine, Ed O'Brien explained why they did so at a June 2006 concert at Madison Square Garden: \"Putting '15 Step' and 'Morning Bell' together was deliberate. '15 Step' is in 5/4 and 'Morning Bell' is in 7/8. It's nice to have a bit of clapping, a bit of audience participation, if they can get the beat.

{"text": "“Driving no-frills punk” (Under the Radar) purveyors, TVOD (Brooklyn, NY), are unearthing Party Time, their debut full-length dropping in Spring 2025. Building on their previous releases, the album features Tyler Wright’s uncanny melodic sense and lovingly cranky approach to songwriting/lyrics, complimented by dynamic guitar riffs alongside lush synthesizer layers that elevate the rhythm section’s robust post-punk grooves. And though the album’s title could suggest otherwise, Party Time is more often than not introspective prose heartedly crammed into punk rock scorchers, depicting the bittersweet realities of the Big Apple’s nightlife scene through blatantly candid commentary, leading to poignant and highly-relatable songs. While grungy rock & roll aficionados will no doubt get their fix along the way, they, too, will shiver to the tune of heart-wrenching tales of deceit, addiction and disbelief, as much as they will grin in connivance as they become more and more acquainted with TVOD’s sordid humor and charismatic storytelling. Perhaps their most organic work to date, Party Time was recorded live off-the-floor, celebrating TVOD’s genuine comradery in printing a full reel of clever if unabashed punk music. Lured in by the producer duo of Félix Bélisle and Samuel Gemme, Wright (vocals), along with bandmates Mem Pahl (drums & synthesizers), Micki Piccirillo (bass), Jenna Mark (vocals & synthesizers), Serge Zbrizher (guitar), and Denim Casimir (guitar), drove up to indie mecca, Montréal, Québec, to record at Gamma Recording Studio (Corridor, Population II, La Sécurité).

Lured in by the producer duo of Félix Bélisle and Samuel Gemme, Wright (vocals), along with bandmates Mem Pahl (drums & synthesizers), Micki Piccirillo (bass), Jenna Mark (vocals & synthesizers), Serge Zbrizher (guitar), and Denim Casimir (guitar), drove up to indie mecca, Montréal, Québec, to record at Gamma Recording Studio (Corridor, Population II, La Sécurité). The resulting 11-song essay promises a visceral listening experience, filled with chaotic emotions and sharp humor, capturing the essence of TVOD’s unique sound. \n\nhttps://televisionoverdose.bandcamp.com/album/party-time"}, "spans": [{"start": 54, "end": 58, "label": "ARTIST_NAME", "text": "TVOD", "source": "metadata_match_v4_normalized_word_boundaries"}, {"start": 90, "end": 100, "label": "ALBUM_TITLE", "text": "Party Time", "source": "metadata_match_v4_normalized_word_boundaries"}, {"start": 481, "end": 491, "label": "ALBUM_TITLE", "text": "Party Time", "source": "metadata_match_v4_normalized_word_boundaries"}, {"start": 996, "end": 1000, "label": "ARTIST_NAME", "text": "TVOD", "source": "metadata_match_v4_normalized_word_boundaries"}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1097, "label": "ALBUM_TITLE", "text": "Party Time", "source": "metadata_match_v4_normalized_word_boundaries"}, {"start": 1143, "end": 1147, "label": "ARTIST_NAME", "text": "TVOD", "source": "metadata_match_v4_normalized_word_boundaries"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1740, "label": "ARTIST_NAME", "text": "TVOD", "source": "metadata_match_v4_normalized_word_boundaries"}]}

{"text": "For over two decades now, LA native Kevin Litrow has been carving his own unique musical path. Having spent the first half of his career playing in various bands and side projects, it is under the moniker of Litronix, that Litrow has now spent close to a decade and half crafting his own distinctive brand of futuristic synth pop. About the album: In 1942, The US Pentecostal Church Development Department made a robot preacher to replace human preachers who were abroad in the war. All was going well until its program was bought out by a pharmaceutical company through regular software updates. They started to add sales pitches to its speech program. After the war, the human preachers returned and the ‘Litronix’ program was closed down In late 1945. The ‘Litronix’ was driven out to the Nevada desert and buried in an unknown location. Fast forward 80 years, whilst digging the new foundations of a hotel, the ‘Litronix’ was discovered still awake and fully functioning. On its awakening, the ‘Litronix’ started to walk in the direction of Los Angeles. Over the past few years, living in LA, its religious and pharmaceutical programs have evolved into a more spiritual and holistic approach. Its external hard drive has downloaded more than 4500 documents on the subject of hypnosis. Government agencies and many new American business oligarchs have approached the ‘Litronix’ with job offers. The ‘Litronix’ refused. The ‘Litronix’ model also started to record jingles and songs on its internal recording system.

Although my wife April never ordered them they somehow arrived a few weeks after Kienan passed away. It was of course really difficult to open the package. It took us months to get the courage to hang them, but when we finally did we noticed that sometimes when we talked about Kienan the lights would start blinking off and on. Our friends and family would try to figure it out or fix them, but we knew it was a sign that Kienan was still with us and that some bonds can’t be broken. So that become the “Star String Radio”. I hope everyone can find some hope and healing through the song the way we did.\" https://suzzallo.bandcamp.com/album/the-quiet-year-2", "meta": {"play_id": 3497901, "dj_host_names": null, "play_airdate": "2025-05-06T15:44:18Z", "db_song_id": "suzzallo-star string radio", "db_song_title": "Star String Radio", "db_album_title": "The Quiet Year", "db_artist_name": "Suzzallo", "db_song_release_date": null, "original_comment_text": "Here’s a little about Star String Radio as told by Rocky:\n\n\"This song is about the portal that opens up between two worlds when you lose someone you love deeply.
